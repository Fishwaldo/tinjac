 *  \brief The abstract base class for a paint device
 *
 * A %WPaintDevice is a device on which may be painted using a
 * WPainter. You should never paint directly on a paint device.
 *
 * The device defines the size of the drawing area, using width() and
 * height(). These dimensions must be defined in pixel units. In the
 * future, additional information will be included to convert these pixel
 * units to lengths (using DPI information).
 *
 * You should reimplement this class if you wish to extend the %Wt
 * paint system to paint on other devices than the ones provided by
 * the library.
 *
 * <i>Note: this interface is subject to changes to increase
 * optimization possibilities for the painting using different
 * devices.</i>
