/*! \class WServer Wt/WServer Wt/WServer
 *  \brief A class encapsulating an application server.
 *
 * This server class represents an instance of an application server.
 *
 * It offers support for multiple application entry points and control
 * over starting and stopping the server (the latter functionality is
 * only for supported for the built-in httpd). This may be used as an
 * alternative to using WRun() when you wish to support multiple
 * application entry points, or for integrating a Wt (stand-alone
 * httpd) server application into an existing application, when you want
 * to and start and stop the server as appropriate.
 *
 * As an example usage, consider the implementation of WRun(), which
 * starts the server until a Ctrl-C is pressed or a termination signal
 * has been received, or a restart is indicated using SIGHUP or a changed
 * binary (argv[0]):
 *
 * \code
int WRun(int argc, char *argv[], ApplicationCreator createApplication)
{
  try {
    // use argv[0] as the application name to match a suitable entry
    // in the Wt configuration file, and use the default configuration
    // file (which defaults to /etc/wt/wt_config.xml unless the environment
    // variable WT_CONFIG_XML is set)
    WServer server(argv[0]);

    // WTHTTP_CONFIGURATION is e.g. "/etc/wt/wthttpd"
    server.setServerConfiguration(argc, argv, WTHTTP_CONFIGURATION);

    // add a single entry point, at the default location (as determined
    // by the server configuration's deploy-path)
    server.addEntryPoint(Wt::Application, createApplication);
    if (server.start()) {
      int sig = WServer::waitForShutdown(argv[0]);

      std::cerr << "Shutdown (signal = " << sig << ")" << std::endl;
      server.stop();

      if (sig == SIGHUP)
	WServer::restart(argc, argv, environ);
    }
  } catch (WServer::Exception& e) {
    std::cerr << e.what() << "\n";
    return 1;
  } catch (std::exception& e) {
    std::cerr << "exception: " << e.what() << "\n";
    return 1;
  }
}
 * \endcode
 *
 * \note Currently, only a single server instance may be created. We plan to
 *       remove this limiation in the future.
