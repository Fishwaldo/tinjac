    <p>Wt's video support is work in progress, but there are already a few
      ways to play video in Wt. Currently, methods based on the HTML5 Video
      element and Flash are provided.

    <h2>HTML5 Playback</h2>
    <p>Below is a WHTML5Video class, with a WImage (a static JPEG image) as
      fallback. The HTML5 video will play on browsers that support MP4 or OGV
      video streams (firefox, chrome, safari, ...), and show the image
      on other browsers (Internet Explorer, opera, ...).

    <h2>HTML5 Playback with Flash fallback</h2>
    <p>For browsers that support HTML5 video, the video below looks exactly like
      the one above. On other browsers, the player below falls back to a
      Flash player, which plays an MP4 video. If flash is not supported on
      your system, a static image is shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Flash-based video player can be any player. The example below uses
      <a href="http://flv-player.net/" target="_blank">FLV Player</a> as
      fallback for HTML5 video, but any flash player can do the job.
